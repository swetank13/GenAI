    "#### 3.2: How LLMs work\n",
    "- Fundamentally LLMs use Autoregressive Generation.\n",
    "- System 1 thinking: Fast, Intuitive, automatic thinking (Ex: Recognize face, Drive on a known route).\n",
    "- System 2 thinking: Slow, Analytical and effortful (Ex: Getting married to a person, Building a business strategy).\n",
    "- LLMs are autoregressive models where they predict one token at a time and use tokens produced from the first iteration as input in the next one to produce new tokens.\n",
    "- Transformer architecture is the core of any LLM.\n",
    "- Training an LLM requires a huge amount of resources, and the cost associated with training is very high."

    "#### 3.3: Context Window, Temperature, Top-p and Top-k\n",
    "- `Context Window` determines the number of past tokens an LLM considers when generating the next token, influencing coherence and memory.\n",
    "- `Temperature` controls randomness in text generation: Higher values → more creative outputs, Lower values → more deterministic results. It controls how random or creative the model's output will be.\n",
    "- `Top-p (nucleus) sampling` selects tokens from the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds p, dynamically adjusting the token pool size. Used for creative and diverse task (Ex: Chatbots, Storytelling).\n",
    "- `Top-k sampling` limits token selection to the top k most probable options, reducing randomness while maintaining diversity. Used for predictable, structured tasks (Ex: Writing code, Summarization).\n",
    "- Combining temperature, top-p, and top-k allows fine-tuning of model output, balancing creativity and relevance in text generation (Ex: k=10, p=0.9).\n",
    "- `Output length` set the output length as fixed."

    "- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with text generation, enhancing LLMs with external knowledge.\n",
    "- RAG retrieves relevant documents or data chunks and uses them to generate more accurate and context-aware responses.\n",
    "- This approach reduces hallucination by grounding outputs in factual information from the retrieved content.\n",
    "- RAG is widely used in question answering, chatbots, and document summarization to improve precision and relevance.\n",
    "- By dynamically incorporating up-to-date information, RAG allows LLMs to handle knowledge-intensive tasks beyond their training data."
